A simple chat app using websockets and clojurescript.

It's not really a fully-functional chat program, but it demonstrates
how to use clojurescript to send and receives messages over a websocket,
and display them on the screen.

This app uses jquery instead of google closure.  Chris Granger explains
why this is OK: [ https://github.com/ibdknox/jayq ].

It uses ring/jetty running on port 8080 to serve the normal HTTP requests, and
Webbit running on port 8081 to handle the websocket connections.

To run:

  lein cljsbuild once
  lein run

Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in as many different browser windows as
you'd like.
